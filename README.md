# clippy check

Started from the `actions/typescript-actions` template :rocket:

See the actions-rs [clippy-check](https://github.com/actions-rs/clippy-check) (which isn't [maintained](https://github.com/actions-rs/clippy-check/issues/162)).

Code actually hefted from [LoliGothick/clippy-check](https://github.com/LoliGothick/clippy-check) because that action was not working due to the dist/ dir being out of date. (Originally I had forked it but ultimately decided it would be better to use the typescript-actions preset tooling and just copied the typescript code over.)

So with this repo being based on the typescript-actions template and having updated toolchaining, it hopefully can be maintained and run well.

## Example workflow

```yml
clippy:
    name: clippy check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
          with:
              toolchain: nightly
              components: clippy
              override: true
        - uses: nwesterhausen/clippy-check@v1
          with:
              token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              allow: >
                nonstandard_macro_braces
                mutex_atomic
              deny: warnings  
```
